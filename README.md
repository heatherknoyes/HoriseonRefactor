# HoriseonRefactor

## Description

The motivation for this project was to learn how to read through an existing code base, and to make changes to make it more readable without affecting the overall functionality and look of the website. In this project I refactored an existing code base of the HTML code to have more semantic elements and to be more accessible. In addition, I also refactored the CSS code base to reflect the changes that were done in the HTML code, reordered elements to be in a semantic structure, and consolidated pieces of code for a more streamlined code base. With the completion of this project I fulfilled the following user acceptance criteria.

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

This project taught me how I can expect to potentially see websites as they come through in the real world and be able to edit the code base to bring it up to the standards of today. This is extremely important for accessibility standards as well as time to market for future edits if the website were to be worked on.

## Installation

1. Download all files within the main directory as well as the assets directory to your device.

2. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the website.

3. If future edits need to be made then the stylesheet can be found under ./assets/css/style.css and any accompanying images can be placed in ./assets/images/.

## Usage

The following image shows the web application's appearance in three different screenshots:
