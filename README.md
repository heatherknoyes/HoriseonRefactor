# HoriseonRefactor

In this project I refactored an existing code base of the HTML code to have more semantic elements and to be more accessible. In addition, I also refactored the CSS code base to reflect the changes that were done in the HTML code, reordered elements to be in a semantic structure, and consolidated pieces of code for a more streamlined code base. With the completion of this project I fulfilled the following user acceptance criteria.

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
